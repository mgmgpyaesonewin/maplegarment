              I love this job as it can provide a lot of job opportunities for masses and it can increase their life style. Myanmar garment industry is growing constantly and I believe that, if manufacturers can increase their capacities, it can contribute to the countryâ€™s economic growth. We are now working for international brands and in the near future, we plan to develop our own brand, inspired by Myanmar fashion and we wish to penetrate into global market.
